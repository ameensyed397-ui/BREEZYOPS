# Build Status (live)

Snapshot of what's actually built in `breezyops/` vs. the [[Feature-Index|13-feature spec]]. Update this after every feature lands — this is the "state of the world" for the code, same role [[Project-Context]] plays for the business. See [[Build-Log]] for the change-by-change history and reasoning.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-17 (v0.13 — comprehensive bugfix pass: auth, DB, schedule, PDF, sheets. Build passes clean. Pushed to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploying.)

## Phase 1 progress

## What's live right now

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| Auth (login) | 🟢 Real — Supabase email/phone OTP, two-stage send→verify, working end to end |
| Database | 🟢 Connected — Supabase JS client over HTTPS (direct PG blocked by IPv6). All data queries use real DB. |
| Schema | 🟢 Pushed — 14 tables, 10 enums, all indexes created via Supabase SQL Editor (12-step migration) |
| RLS policies | 🟢 Applied — 20 RBAC policies on all 13 tables, helper functions, auto-profile trigger, catalog_public view |
| Lead webhook intake | 🟢 Code complete, using Supabase JS client, timing-safe secret, error handling |
| Leads inbox UI (F01) | 🟢 Built, real DB data, mutations wired to server actions with revalidation |
| Pipeline boards (F02) | 🟢 Built, real DB data, drag-and-drop persists via `updateLeadStatusAction` / `updateDealStageAction` |
| Schedule (F03) | 🟢 Built, real DB data, day/week/month view, booking sheet wired to `createAppointmentAction`. Day view: Notion-style column layout with hour grid lines, overlap detection, left accent border. Click-to-open appointment detail sheet with status actions (complete, reschedule, no-show, cancel). Week view: today highlight with bg-primary/5. |
| Customers (F05) | 🟢 Built, real DB data — list (All/B2C/B2B tabs, search, revenue) + detail sheet + [id] page |
| Jobs (F04) | 🟢 Built, real DB data — list (All/Scheduled/Active/Done tabs, search) + detail sheet wired to `updateJobStatusAction` |
| Invoices (F09) | 🟢 Built, real DB data — list (All/Draft/Sent/Paid/Overdue tabs, search) + detail sheet wired to `updateInvoiceStatusAction` |
| Settings (F13) | 🟢 Built, wired to real DB — catalog (inline price/cost edit), users (profiles), localities (add/view), integrations, audit log |
| Dashboard KPIs | 🟢 Wired to real DB queries (leads, jobs, invoices, customers, appointments). Name/message/channel fields now read from DB (v0.13 fix). |
| F10 Document & Media | 🟢 Built, real DB data — card grid with gradient thumbnails, type tabs, search, upload stub, detail sheet with preview card |
| Rate limiting | 🟢 In-memory sliding-window rate limiter on auth/confirm (10/min) and webhook (30/min) |
| Sidebar | 🟢 Shadcn sidebar component — collapsible icon mode, active nav highlighting (primary accent + left border), Caveat font brand, toggle in header, clickable logo to expand, avatar profile with initials |
